# Hotel Menu Management System

## Overview
Hi, I'm Pradip Gyawali, and this is my **Hotel Menu Management System**, a simple desktop application built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **SQLite**. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for small hotels or restaurants to manage their menu items efficiently.

The application allows users to add, update, delete, and display menu items through a clean graphical user interface (GUI).

This project is a work in progress, and I'm currently working on exciting features like **QR code generation** to allow customers to access the menu digitally and a **messaging area** where customers can message and place orders directly through the application.

## Features
- ✅ Add Menu Item: Input details like item name, price, and category to add new menu items to the database.
- 🔄 Update Menu Item: Modify existing menu items (e.g., update price or category).
- ❌ Delete Menu Item: Remove menu items from the database.
- 📋 Display Menu: View all menu items in a tabular format within the GUI.
- 💾 Database Storage: Uses SQLite to store menu data persistently.
- 🖥️ User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for a simple and intuitive desktop interface.

## Upcoming Features
- 📱 QR Code Integration: Generate QR codes to allow customers to view the menu digitally.
- 💬 Customer Messaging Area: Enable customers to send messages and place orders directly through the app.
- 🧠 Planned Enhancements:
  - Menu categorization (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner)
  - Search and filter options
  - Admin/staff login system
  - System integrations (see below)

## Technologies Used
- Python – Core programming language
- Tkinter – GUI framework
- SQLite – Lightweight built-in database

## Installation

### ✅ Set Up Python Environment

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If it's missing, install it with:


No additional dependencies are needed — SQLite is built into Python.

## Run the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run:


## Usage

Once the GUI launches:

- 📥 Add Items: Enter item name, price, and category, then click "Add".
- ✏️ Update Items: Select a menu item from the list, edit the fields, and click "Update".
- 🗑️ Delete Items: Select an item and click "Delete".
- 📃 View Menu: All items are displayed in a table within the GUI.

## Project Status 🚧

This project is actively under development. I'm currently focused on:

- 🧾 Implementing QR code generation for digital menu access.
- 💬 Building a messaging area for customer orders and feedback.
- 🛠️ Improving the codebase with error handling and modular structure.
- 💡 Adding new features based on user feedback.

## Future Integrations

To make this system more powerful and scalable, I plan to explore:

- 💳 Payment Gateway Integration: Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- 📦 Order Management System: Real-time order processing.
- ☁️ Cloud Database Support: Use MySQL, Firebase, or similar for multi-user access.
- 📱 Mobile App Integration: Sync app with Android/iOS for staff and customers.
